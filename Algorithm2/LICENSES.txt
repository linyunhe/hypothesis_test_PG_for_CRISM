Notice about licenses for software in this package
-------------------------------------------------------

This software package includes MEX (Matlab EXecutable) binaries compiled from
C++ to run on 64-bit Windows machines. The compiler used was Microsoft Visual
Studio 2015 Community Edition. To make these MEX binaries runnable on Windows
computers that don't have a Microsoft Visual Studio compiler installed, I have
included (a) files(s) for which Microsoft gives authorization to distribute.

This/these files is/are:
	
	* vcomp140.dll
	
In their terms and conditions for this product
(https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/support/legal/mt171547), Microsoft gives
the relavent permission under section 3.a ("REDIST.TXT Files"). Microsoft also
requires us to agree to terms protecting this Redistributable Code that are at
least as strict as its own protection of it. I AM NOT A LAWYER, but this
prohibits us from, at the very least, reverse-engineering the file(s) above.
Therefore, please do not do that.
