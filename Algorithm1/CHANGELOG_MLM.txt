------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in V4.7.0 (25 April 2017)
------------------------------------------------------------
* Now uses a weighted logcosh penalty, minimizing the decoupled
  function at each iteration
* Adds C++ translation of new version of penalty (multithreaded)
* Adds band names for DDR outputs
* Number of threads for C++ MEX functions now settable in test5v5_compact.m
* Removes various old unused code & comments (and performs other cleanup)

------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in V4.6.3 (5 January 2017)
------------------------------------------------------------
* Adds options to block part of S data
* Runs other parts of S data separately 
* Spectral weighting learned from spectrogram
* Saves the spectrogram figure
* Range of spectral weighting for L is allowed to be changed by user
* Saves the cut inputs (SSA/DDR) with the same size of outputs
* Range of spectral weighting for S is fixed to 2

------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in V4.6.1 (4 October 2016)
------------------------------------------------------------
* Cuts off the spatial boundary effects in projected image (but does not do
  so in the unprojected image-space image C)
* Fixes bug in which the columns and bands which were used in processing
  were incorrectly reported in header files

------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in V4.6.0 (12 August 2016)
------------------------------------------------------------
* This version adds multiprocessing-capable C++ versions of the spatial
  projections (forward and back) as well as the log-cosh penalty function.
  This directory contains the source code, in .h and .cpp files, as well as
  those files compiled for Windows, in .mexw64 files. For more information
  about this code and how to build it, see the readme section "About the C++
  MEX Components."
* The new C++ versions of the code are used by default if compiled versions
  are available for the current operating system.
* The gaussian kernels used in the spectral forward and backward projections
  are now normalized. Previously, they summed to a value that was not quite 1.

------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in V4.5.2 (14 July 2016)
------------------------------------------------------------
* Changed the radius of Mars used in spatial projections to 3,396,190 m. This
  change makes all the instances of the radius's use in the program the same
  value.
* The program automatically cuts any all-zero rows and columns that are at the
  edge of the selected region of the SSA.

------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in V4.5.1 (6 July 2016)
------------------------------------------------------------
* Adds support for having a different pixel size for map-projected output from
  that used during processing. It is found in the GUI as "Output Pix Spacing"
* Expands the parts of the scene that have a non-zero initial guess a bit to
  reduce spatial edge artifacts

------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in V4.5.0 (17 June 2016)
------------------------------------------------------------
* Now produces an output product that is truly in the Mars Equirectangular
  projection. This product is saved at the same iterations that C is set to,
  with the filename {observation}_{date}_proj_iter_{#}.bsq. C, which is in
  a local cartesian system, is still written out, too.
* The radius of Mars is now exactly the same as used by SuperGLT: 3,396,190 m.
* The exact ranges of rows, columns, and bands used in a run are displayed in
  the Matlab command window, and are included in all output product header
  files at the beginning of the description section. These numbers take
  into account, e.g., those columns without data that are removed
  automatically, regardless of whether the "Use all columns" box is checked.

------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in V4.4.2 (14 June 2016)
------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixes a bug in the spectral part of the penalty in which the spatial rather
  than spectral beta was used in calculating the penalty hessian.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in V4.4.1 (9 June 2016)
------------------------------------------------------------
* Performance improvements in the spatial projections (for off-nadir
  option). Speedup through better vectorization of kernel-building, to
  complement the changes for nadir-pointing kernels released in version 4.3.0.
  Identical results to previous version.
* Precomputation of spatial kernels now saves to memory rather than to file.
  (It is disabled by default and cannot be enabled from the GUI.)

-------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in V4.4.0 (26 May 2016)
------------------------------------------------------------
* Edge effects in the spectral domain have been reduced. This modification,
  written by Linyun He, assumes that bands beyond the edge have the same value
  as the band on the edge.
* The bad bands list has been removed. Now that the edge effects are
  mitigated, hiding the edge bands is no longer necessary.
* Other small speed improvements.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in V4.3.0 (18 May 2016)
-------------------------------------------------------------
* Performance improvements in the spatial projections (for nadir-pointing
  option). Speedup through better vectorization of kernel-building. Identical
  results to previous version.
* Performance improvements & algorithm improvements to penalty (written by
  Linyun He). Results for penalty runs are NOT identical to previous versions.
* Edge bands are no longer cut off output files. Instead, the 3 highest and 3
  lowest bands are left in output files but added to the bad-bands list via
  the ENVI header. This is a temporary solution, to be replaced with a method
  of hiding these poorly-behaved bands that is compatible with more programs
  than just ENVI.
* Fixes a bug in 4.2.1 in which the "proj. scene start file" browse button
  would not work.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in V4.2.1 (25 January 2016)
-------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixes crashing bug caused by error in default bands implementation,
  that would kill the program whenever output files were saved.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in V4.2.0 (22 January 2016)
-------------------------------------------------------------
* ENVI headers saved by the program now contain a setting of the
  "default bands" property. For L-data, the bands listed for RGB correspond
  to bands 206, 361, and 429 in WA respectively. For S-data, the bands are
  54, 37, and 27. If any of those bands would not be included in the output
  data, the property will not be included in the header file.
* Output files will now have their 3 highest and 3 lowest bands cut off before
  saving, since those bands are dominated by edge effects. This is not currently
  configurable in the GUI.
* The version number of this software is now displayed prominently on the GUI.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in V4.1.1 (21 December 2015)
-------------------------------------------------------------
* Bugfix to allow successful saving/loading of GUI options that include
  filenames

-------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in V4.1.0 (18 December 2015)
-------------------------------------------------------------
* Rolling off-nadir geometry is now available. In the GUI, it can be selected
  under "geometry selection."
* Saving/loading files of GUI options is available through the "load options
  file" and "save options file" buttons.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in V4.0.1 (9 December 2015)
-------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixes to some bugs that caused program to crash when off-nadir geometry
  was selected

-------------------------------------------------------------
New changes in V4 (13 November 2015)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Starting in version 4, a GUI can be used to start runs of the algorithm. To
use the GUI, execute crism_gui from a Matlab prompt in this directory.

The method of editing parameters of the algorithm in test5v5_compact.m is
still possible, though for routine runs it is less convenient than using the
GUI.

Both these methods are explained in more detail in the readme, as well as a method
useful for experimentation that uses the script as a function.

* Complete removal of the off-nadir rolling geometry mode. The mode previously
  called "old geometry" has been changed to "nadir" and "new geometry" has
  been changed to "off-nadir" to future-proof them. Both use flat geometry
  rather than rolling.
* Addition of full-featured Matlab GUI for starting runs. The GUI has options
  corresponding to nearly everything that the script version can do (including
  all options that are used for runs on a regular basis).
